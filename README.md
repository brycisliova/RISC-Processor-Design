# 16-Bit RISC Pipeline Microprocessor

## Introduction
Welcome to the repository for our EE309: Microprocessor Systems project at IIT Bombay. This repository documents the design and implementation of a 16-bit RISC pipeline microprocessor. The project focused on creating a CPU with a six-stage pipeline architecture based on the RISC principles, optimizing both performance and efficiency.

## Core Concepts Implemented
### Pipeline
The project features a six-stage pipeline architecture that improves CPU performance by executing multiple instructions simultaneously. The stages include:
- Instruction Fetch (IF)
- Instruction Decode (ID)
- Register Read (RR)
- Execute (EX)
- Memory Access (MEM)
- Write Back (WB)

To manage the hazards that arise from this approach, we implemented forwarding and stalling techniques to ensure smooth pipeline operation.

### RISC Architecture
Our microprocessor follows the RISC architecture, using simple, fixed-length instructions to enable efficient pipelining and faster execution compared to CISC architectures.

## The Six Stages of Pipelining
1. **Instruction Fetch (IF)**: The next instruction is fetched from memory.
2. **Instruction Decode (ID)**: The fetched instruction is decoded and prepared for execution.
3. **Register Read (RR)**: Register values are read and any hazards are addressed using forwarding or stalling.
4. **Execute (EX)**: The Arithmetic Logic Unit (ALU) performs the required operation.
5. **Memory Access (MEM)**: The instruction either reads from or writes to memory.
6. **Write Back (WB)**: The result of the instruction is written back to the register file.

## Handling Hazards
### Data Hazards
We used data forwarding and stalling techniques to resolve data hazards effectively, ensuring that the pipeline does not stall unnecessarily.

### Control Hazards
Control hazards, arising from branching and jump instructions, were managed with a dynamic branch predictor. Incorrect predictions triggered a recovery process that flushed incorrect instructions.

## Datapath Design
The pipeline includes several core components, such as:
- Instruction Decoder
- Control Unit
- Arithmetic and Logic Unit (ALU)
- Memory Management Unit (MMU)
- Hazard control units

These components were carefully designed and integrated to optimize performance and minimize hazards.
